  title: "Emergent Quantum Systems Lab"
  content: "Welcome to the Emergent Quantum Systems Lab (EQSL) at the University of Notre Dame! <br /><br />

Our lab explores topics at the intersection of condensed matter physics and quantum information science. We combine nanoscale quantum electronic and photonic devices with macroscopic quantum liquids and solids to reveal exotic quantum phenomena and create transformative quantum technologies. Our research could lead to ideal platforms for quantum computing, networking, and sensing that will fundamentally change the way we think and live."

    image: "/images/x-mon+on+fridge.jpg"
    content: "Using superconducting circuits as a backbone we study hybrid quantum systems, linking diverse microscopic degrees of freedom together. We trap electrons floating on liquid helium above superconducting cavities. We study waves of superfluid helium in microchannels. In addition we collaborate with the Cleland and Awschalom groups to study spin physics and nanomechanics in solids."
