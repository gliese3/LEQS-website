## Overview

We are broadly interested in any quantum materials and devices in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. 

* Quantum Materials: we are particularly interested in strongly correlated quantum liquid and solid systems, such as superfluid helium 3 and helium 4, solid hydrogen and neon, high temperature superconductors, topological superconductors, fractional quantum Hall liquids, and quantum spin liquids.

* Quantum Devices: we are particularly interested in highly integrated quantum electronic and photonic systems, such as single-electron-based quantum processors, single-ion-based quantum transducers, and single-photon-based quantum sensors.
